# Name
Fitness Club

# Description
That's my simple university study project created for the fitness club domain. Fitness Club is designed for two categories of users: administrators and trainers. Thanks to this software, administrators can, e. g. hire new employee, and trainers are able to, for instance, subscribe a client to the fitness club or renew a subscription for the client.
